## Announcing PowerShellAIAssistant!

I'm excited to announce that I am expanding the AI-powered PowerShell tools with a new module: `PowerShellAIAssistant`! This new project focuses on leveraging the latest OpenAI Assistant API, and more, providing enhanced conversational AI capabilities within PowerShell.

### Why a New Module?

- **Dedicated Support**: PowerShellAIAssistant is tailored to support the new features and API changes introduced by OpenAI, ensuring you have the most up-to-date tools at your disposal.
- **Community-Driven Development**: The development of PowerShellAIAssistant will be done in public. We're embracing open collaboration and invite you to join us in shaping its future.

### Get Involved

- Check out the new [PowerShellAIAssistant repository](https://github.com/dfinke/PowerShellAIAssistant) to see the progress and contribute.
- Follow along as we build in public and share your thoughts, feedback, or code!

I believe this new module will be a valuable asset to the community, and encourage you to get involved. Let's build something amazing together!

The `PowerShellAI` module will continue to be supported while also nurturing the growth of `PowerShellAIAssistant`. Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm!
